# Gene-Expression-Correlation-with-Methylation-and-Cellular-Aging-at-Single-Cell-Resolution

Our project investigates finding the difference between chronological age and biological age of cells.
So what can you find here?
data1.rdata - the file contains the entire initial analysis that includes all types of cells sequenced in the single cell RNA-seq technology.
data1.rdata - this file contains the continuation of the analysis that was performed only on the cells on which we also received information about the methylation.
convert mini project - code indicating a subtle conversion performed on the columns in order to add the chronological age
convert metadata2 - code that matches the columns to the cell barcodes on the file that comes out of the methylation analysis.
